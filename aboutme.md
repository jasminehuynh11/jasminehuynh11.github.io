My name is Jasmine Huynh, and I am an aspiring AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist, deeply passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful solutions and sharing knowledge through research and teaching. Currently pursuing a Master's in Information Technology majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Macquarie University, I am fueled by a love for learning and empowering others through education.


### My journey

I began my academic path with a Bachelor’s in Business Analytics after transitioning from a background in Business Marketing. My early career as a Customer Data Analyst and later as a Product Owner sparked my enthusiasm for data and problem-solving. These roles taught me the importance of using data to drive decisions and foster collaboration across teams.

While advancing professionally, I also found joy in teaching. Mentoring students and guiding them in their academic and career pursuits is a reflection of my commitment to sharing knowledge. This passion led me to roles like Computing Drop-In Assistant and Research Assistant, where I help others navigate complex concepts in AI, programming, and data science.

### My professional experiences
Throughout my journey, I’ve had the privilege of working on impactful projects, including:

Research Intern at CSIRO x Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre: Simulating energy consumption patterns using Large Language Models for a data-driven approach to Australia’s energy transition.
Product Owner at Buymed: Spearheading ERP system enhancements and implementing a QR code system, significantly improving operational efficiency.
Data and AI Strategy Analyst at Horizon X: Crafting AI governance frameworks and delivering strategic insights on AI adoption in retail.
These experiences have honed my skills in leadership, technical innovation, and strategic thinking.
